## About the Video Course
Audio is what Apple is known for. The iPod and Apple’s dedication to audio is what ultimately led to the iPhone and the whole iOS ecosystem. In this course, you’ll learn how to work with and harness the power of audio in your iOS development.
The two fundamental skills that you will master in this course are playing and recording audio. We’ll start by playing an audio file. Whether you want background music in a game or need to play podcast files, you’ll learn how to work with the audio frameworks Apple has developed. Then we’ll move on to recording audio with built-in microphones in iOS devices.
You’ll end the course by taking your learning and practically applying it to create a Soundboard app that connects to a Core Data database. Through this, a user can record a sound, give it a name, and be able to play the sound with the touch of a button.
